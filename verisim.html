<h1>VeriSIM</h1>
</div>
<p>VeriSIM(<b>Veri</b>fying designs by <b>SIM</b>ulating scenarios) is a web-based self-learning learning environment which trains learners to apply the design tracing pedagogy. VeriSIM is available online to use on the following <a target="_blank" href="http://verisim.tech">link</a> (VeriSIM works best on Google Chrome. Some functionalities may not work on other browsers)<br /></p>
<p>In VeriSIM, learners are first introduced to the requirements and design diagrams for an &lsquo;&lsquo;Automated Door Locking System&rsquo;&rsquo;. They then trace scenarios in the design using the design tracing pedagogy. Finally, they reflect on their overall learning and how it will be useful for them in the future. In VeriSIM, these activities are presented as various challenges to learners. VeriSIM takes learners through different stages which contain challenges. The three stages are - Problem Understanding Stage, Design Tracing Stage and Reflection Stage. As learners attempt these challenges, they gain points and acquire skills.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>After learners log in to the system, they are presented with the learning objectives of VeriSIM. They then view an introductory video. In the video, learners are presented with a situation where they have graduated and entered a software startup company as a software developer. After watching the video, learners are directed to the VeriSIM dashboard which contains the three stages and corresponding challenges in each stage.</p>

<h2>Problem Understanding Stage</h2>
<p>There are three challenges in the Problem Understanding Stage - Understanding requirements, understanding the design diagrams and understanding scenarios. learners are introduced to the requirements and the software design of an &lsquo;&lsquo;Automated Door Locking System&rsquo;&rsquo;. VeriSIM also explains what is meant by a scenario and displays a scenario based on the design. Each challenge is followed by evaluation questions which test their understanding of the concept learnt.</p>

<h2>Design Tracing Stage</h2>
<p>In the Design Tracing Stage, learners are introduced to the design tracing strategy. This stage comprises four challenges in increasing order of complexity. In the first challenge, they observe the run of the state diagram i.e the execution of trace of the scenario. In the second challenge, there is an error in the data flow, which the learner has to correct. In the third challenge, the entire data flow has to be traced by the learner. In the fourth challenge, control flow and data flow has to be traced. In each challenge, a different scenario of the same design is provided. Learners are free to attempt the challenges in any order. Each challenge is followed by reflective and evaluative questions</p>
<p><b>Challenge 1: Explore the model and Challenge 2: Correct the model</b></p>

<p><b> Challenge 3: Complete the model </b></p>

<h2>Reflection Stage</h2>
<p>In the Reflection Stage, the system provides learners with reflection questions which helps them summarize what they learnt in the previous two stages and their perceptions of the usefulness of the design tracing pedagogy</p>
