    "text": "I first joined Twitter in 2016 when I was a junior PhD student. At that time, our department was hosting an international conference, and as part of the organising committee, we decided to post questions and reflections of various sessions on Twitter.\nFrom that time on, Twitter has been my main source to get regular updates about what’s happening in my area, and the world in general. What I’ve realised over the years is that Twitter is a great place to get to know what other people in your field are upto - what they are working on, the papers they have published, and the ideas they are grappling with.\nTwitter is also a great way to start interactions and discussions with other academics. The idea that Twitter is a townhall is quite accurate. There hasn’t been a time in history when you could directly respond to experienced researchers or influential people in your field.\nTwitter also provides you the opportunity to add your own voice and experience into the conversation. This can seem daunting at first - how can you possibly add something to a discussion with experienced people in your field? But that’s how you start. Most of the time, even if you don’t have something to contribute, you can add some nuance to an existing thread or discussion.\nHowever, you may have questions or doubts -\nTwitter as a platform can also be engaging and addictive, that there will be times when you can’t seem to stay off Twitter (that’s what it is designed for!). I quickly realised that I needed a strategy to engage with Twitter in an effective manner."

    "text": "My Twitter Engagement Strategy\nHow do I optimise my Twitter usage so that it advances my primary purpose of engaging with the academic community? Here’s what I came up with.\n\nI only follow people whose work/opinions/updates I’m interested in. This may seem obvious, but its very easy to fall into the trap of following Twitter handles of companies, news agencies, funny memes and cat videos. That does not mean that news updates and cat memes are not important; just that they serve as a distraction to my original intent of engaging with the academic community.\nI’ve decided that I will engage with Twitter only on particular days. For me, it’s Tuesday and Friday - for 15 minutes each day. I try to stick to these days, and mostly I’m successful. I keep a countdown timer on my computer which let’s me know when my time runs out.\nI’ve found that using Twitter twice a week is sufficient for my primary need of engaging with the community. I get important updates and news from people I’m following. Some posts might get missed, and that’s ok.\nDuring each Twitter session, I also try to reply to posts or threads I find interesting, or for which I have a question to ask. Sometimes, you come across an insightful post or thread, and a simple thank you to the author and mentioning why it was interesting is a good way of engaging with others on Twitter.\nWhile scrolling through Twitter, when I come across links to other material, I open them onto a new tab, so that I can refer to these videos/articles/resources after my Twitter session.\nOccassionaly, I post questions or thoughts which have been lingering in my mind. (I don’t do this often, but I would like to do it more!) Again, the variety of replies and perspectives from the Twitter-hive helps you re-think through your own position or idea.\n\nSo that’s it. I’ve been following this strategy for several years now, and it has served my purpose for engaging with the academic community."

    "text": "Be intentional about your social media usage\nIf you are a student or a young professional, I believe you can effectively engage with Twitter. For that matter, I’m sure such a strategy will work for other social media platforms as well. The bottom line is - we have to be very intentional about how we spend our time on social media (Cal Newport’s excellent book “Digital Minimalism” helped me realise this!).\nIdentifying the purposes of using a social media platform, and having an effective engagement strategy which advances these purposes will leave you more fulfilled and content with your social media usage."

I was really looking forward to attend the conference, as I wanted to meet and catch up with a lot of people. The “talking” and “catching up” resulted in missing out on many paper sessions! However, there were still a lot of ideas and insights to glean from the talks and discussion.\nHere are some of them."

    "text": "Paulo Blikstein - Transforming Maker Education into a Platform for Cultural Enrichment and Social Imagination\n\nThere is no “final formula” for education. There is always a perenial battle of design and re-design. Education is incremental.\n\n\nWe need to transition from the “information transmission” model to the “enriching reinterpretation and reconstruction” model.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to remove spaces\n\nPaulo was refering to the advantage of creating designated “spaces” (e.g. a makerspace room) in a school. Even though curricula, activities and teachers change, a space once allocated remains for a long time.\n\nMost educational interventions do not get implemented because teachers are afraid.\n\n\nIdea: Introduce a new kind of teacher - “a pedagogical redesign teacher” to partner with teachers to integrated making into the curriculum\n\nThe “fear of failure” is a valid concern that teachers have in introducing a new activity in their classroom. The “pedagogical redesign teacher” partners with curriculum teachers to redesign activities, and hence can alleviate curriculum teachers’ concerns of failing.\n\n\n\nClay making in Brazil involves a lot of rituals and social rules, and non-human entities such as the “Mother of Clay”\n\n\n\nDocumenting how people makes things in their own context brings out the cultural richness involved in making things. There are non-traditional practices that can inform learning of making in classrooms.\n\n(Paulo was talking about this in Brazilian contexts;seems to be possible in India, which has a rich diversity in terms of making).\n\n\n\nThe plant burns at the same temperature as the baking of the cookies in this oven. Hence, the plant acts as a thermometer. These communities have a lot of scientific knowledge embeded in their making practices.\n\n\n\nMaking can be done for survival and creativity, but also for “sprituality”, “aesthetic enjoyment”, “identity affirmation”, “political organization”, and “cultural transmission”\n\nHow can we re-imagine making for these purposes?\nThe entire keynote video can be found here."

    "text": "Wenli Chen - Computer-Supported Collaborative Argumentation: Technological and Pedagogical Design\n\nThere are no separate ICT teachers. All teachers are ICT teachers.\n\n\nThe Singapore government requires that every student should have a personal learning device (PLD). Hence, if teachers say - “Don’t switch on your laptops” in the classroom, it is politically incorrect, as they would be going against the government mandate.\n\nThis is an interesting case of how top-level policies can influence grass root implementations and behaviours.\n\nEdTech is never a solved problem. It constantly evolves\n\n\nAnalytics of learning vs. Analytics for learning - insights from data can be used by students to inform their own learning\n\n\n\n\nThe APPLE TREE system for collaborative argumentation\n\n\nThe entire keynote video can be found here."

    "text": "Amina Charania - Teacher Professional Development in the Indian government school system\n\nThere are two prominent models of teacher development - the Cascade Model and the Nested Approach. The cascade model involves training the teacher, who then trains the next set of teachers and so on. The nested approach involves the initial trainers maintaining contact upto the last level.\n\n\nIdea: Early mentors - Teachers who completed the course content well before time were asked to be mentors to the others who were part of the same course. Such early mentors may have completed the course not just because of their ability, but also due to other factors such as more experience, exposure, and more access to infrastructure.\n\n\nIn teacher professional development, provide content that is relevant to teachers’ immediate contexts.\n\n\nConstantly acknowledge teachers in peer groups, as well as state and national levels.\n\n\nProvide flexible accreditation to teachers in the form of certificates, badges etc.\n\nThe entire keynote video can be found here."

    "text": "Panel - Mainstreaming EdTech Innovations in India\nDr. T. G. Lakshmi moderated an excellent panel on - Navigating the EdTech Landscape: A Panel Discussion on Mainstreaming EdTech Innovations in India. The panelists were:\n\nNirmal Patel - CEO of Smart Paper and Chief Data Scientist at Playpower Labs\nMandar Kulkarni - Co Founder of Gatuvit and The Labs\nRitesh Agarwal - VP at Educational Initiatives\nVeenita Shah - Head Research & Strategy at Tata ClassEdge\n\nHere are some salient quotes from the panel presentations and discussions.\n\nWe don’t need more solutions; we need solutions used in the right way\n\n\nHow do you make EdTech that works rather than technology that shines?\n\n\nEffective implementation (of EdTech interventions on the ground) cannot be envisioned without effective training\n\n\nEdTech in India places a lot of emphasis on data collection and assessments, but not much focus on contextualisation and teacher training.\n\n\nContext is important, especially in India. Context involves not only contextualising content (e.g. pizza vs. roti vs. dosa), but also delivery (how to deliver solutions to urban vs rural populations)\n\n\nEdTech solutions should cater to 4 types of teachers - those with (1) high motivation and high competence, (2) high motivation but low competence, (3) low motivation but high competence and (4) low motivation and low competence\n\nI came back from the conference with a renewed hope that EdTech in India is moving in the right direction - it’s not just about profits and providing solutions to the masses, but in understanding the complexities and nuances that are needed in providing an enriching learning experience to the next generation of learners in India. These are exciting times for EdTech in India, and I’m glad that I am getting to experience this first-hand and contribute in small ways towards this grand vision of improving Indian education. Can’t wait to see what T4E 2024 has in store!"
