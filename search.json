    "section": "",
    "text": "I first joined Twitter in 2016 when I was a junior PhD student. At that time, our department was hosting an international conference, and as part of the organising committee, we decided to post questions and reflections of various sessions on Twitter.\nFrom that time on, Twitter has been my main source to get regular updates about what‚Äôs happening in my area, and the world in general. What I‚Äôve realised over the years is that Twitter is a great place to get to know what other people in your field are upto - what they are working on, the papers they have published, and the ideas they are grappling with.\nTwitter is also a great way to start interactions and discussions with other academics. The idea that Twitter is a townhall is quite accurate. There hasn‚Äôt been a time in history when you could directly respond to experienced researchers or influential people in your field.\nTwitter also provides you the opportunity to add your own voice and experience into the conversation. This can seem daunting at first - how can you possibly add something to a discussion with experienced people in your field? But that‚Äôs how you start. Most of the time, even if you don‚Äôt have something to contribute, you can add some nuance to an existing thread or discussion.\nHowever, you may have questions or doubts -\nTwitter as a platform can also be engaging and addictive, that there will be times when you can‚Äôt seem to stay off Twitter (that‚Äôs what it is designed for!). I quickly realised that I needed a strategy to engage with Twitter in an effective manner."

    "text": "My Twitter Engagement Strategy\nHow do I optimise my Twitter usage so that it advances my primary purpose of engaging with the academic community? Here‚Äôs what I came up with.\n\nI only follow people whose work/opinions/updates I‚Äôm interested in. This may seem obvious, but its very easy to fall into the trap of following Twitter handles of companies, news agencies, funny memes and cat videos. That does not mean that news updates and cat memes are not important; just that they serve as a distraction to my original intent of engaging with the academic community.\nI‚Äôve decided that I will engage with Twitter only on particular days. For me, it‚Äôs Tuesday and Friday - for 15 minutes each day. I try to stick to these days, and mostly I‚Äôm successful. I keep a countdown timer on my computer which let‚Äôs me know when my time runs out.\nI‚Äôve found that using Twitter twice a week is sufficient for my primary need of engaging with the community. I get important updates and news from people I‚Äôm following. Some posts might get missed, and that‚Äôs ok.\nDuring each Twitter session, I also try to reply to posts or threads I find interesting, or for which I have a question to ask. Sometimes, you come across an insightful post or thread, and a simple thank you to the author and mentioning why it was interesting is a good way of engaging with others on Twitter.\nWhile scrolling through Twitter, when I come across links to other material, I open them onto a new tab, so that I can refer to these videos/articles/resources after my Twitter session.\nOccassionaly, I post questions or thoughts which have been lingering in my mind. (I don‚Äôt do this often, but I would like to do it more!) Again, the variety of replies and perspectives from the Twitter-hive helps you re-think through your own position or idea.\n\nSo that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôve been following this strategy for several years now, and it has served my purpose for engaging with the academic community."

    "title": "ACM CompEd and COMPUTE 2023: Bridging the Local and the Global",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The first ACM computing education conference I attended in India was COMPUTE 2019. ACM India organizes COMPUTE annually, and from 2018, the aim of COMPUTE has been towards improving the quality of computing education in India. On similar lines, SIGCSE introduced CompEd, as the 4th global conference, mainly to foster a CSEd community outside North America and Europe. The first CompEd was held in 2019 in Chengdu, China, with the next edition planned in 2021. And then, as we all know, the pandemic hit, which forced the organizers to consider whether to go with a virtual conference, or wait till things settled down. I‚Äôm glad they waited, which resulted in a physical CompEd at IIIT Hyderabad.\nI was looking forward to connect with people from India, who I met in previous COMPUTE conferences, and also folks who I got to meet and interact from other SIGCSE conferences. CompEd and COMPUTE had a nice mix of the Indian and the global - a lot of problems and solutions in computing education does translate to the Indian context. On the other hand, there are so many interesting problems to tackle owing to the richness and diversity of India, and the conference led to some interesting discussions on these lines.\nI arrived late for CompEd, so I missed the first day‚Äôs keynote and morning sessions. And unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt attend many other sessions. Here are some learnings, ideas and takeaways from the sessions I attended.\n\nTeaching Programmers to Think of Program Dynamics\nAamod Sane introduced the trace-first paradigm in his presentation. Students fail in small programs as they do not understand program dynamics i.e.¬†the underlying execution of the program. So instead of starting with the static aspects of a program, like the program text, the idea is to make students construct a trace - which is basically modelling the sequence of values of variables over time. This forms a table like structure as shown in the figure below.\n\n\n\nThe trace for a simple loop. The trace (on the left) is constructed first, which can aid in writing the program\n\n\nHence variable assignments become temporal, and changes of variable values are directly visible in the trace. This dynamic behaviour can also help in understanding causal dependencies across and within dependencies in a loop. More details can be found in the paper here\n\n\nInvestigating Themes of Student-Generated Analogies\nAnalogies are a great way of making connections between what students have already experienced with what they want to learn. In this paper, Colton Harper tried to assess student-generated analogies for computer science concepts they learnt, and used it as a means to gauge student understanding and identified patterns, strengths and weaknesses in them. Colton found that although a diverse range of analogies were created, some were inconsistent and incorrect. We had a fascinating discussion after the presentation on cultural differences in understanding analogies, and assessing analogies which instructors are unfamiliar with. More details can be found in the paper here\nüí°How can we use analogies in Indian classrooms?\n\n\nStudent Reflections on Service-Learning in Software Engineering and Their Experiences with Non-technical Clients\nThe next presentation in this session was by Stan Kurkovsky. He spoke about Service-Learning (a term I was totally unaware of), which refers to meaningful community service integrated into instruction. Service learning is a great way to teach civic responsibility as well as strengthen community. In the presentation, Stan described how his students worked with non-technical clients to provide a software solution in their organisation. As expected, students learnt a lot - how different computing topics complement each other, how to translate their ideas to non-technical clients, and how to lower technological barriers for non-technical clients. It also increased students‚Äô motivation to do the project, as they realised that it will directly benefit other people. More details in the paper here\nüí°Listening to the talk made me wonder how service-learning can be a great way to introduce computing in schools, especially in rural contexts (kind of like the work CSPathshala is doing).\n\n\nKeynote: Empowering the Next Generation of Computational Thinkers\nYasmin Kafai‚Äôs talk focussed on what it actually means to being ‚Äúcomputationally fluent‚Äù and the different framings of computational thinking one needs to be aware of. Being ‚Äúcomputationally fluent‚Äù is quite different from being ‚Äúdigitally fluent‚Äù, which was the goal of computer science in the 1960s. Today, most students have access to computational devices and engage in several activities such as ‚ÄúHour of Code‚Äù, and work with ‚ÄúRoblox‚Äù and ‚ÄúScratch‚Äù (is this true in India? Probably not!). Yasmin described three ways in which one can frame computational thinking -\n\nCognitive - which involves competency and skill building\nSituated - which involves personal expression and social connection through computational creation\nCritical - which involves developing agency and voice using computation.\n\n\n\n\nYasmin Kafai describing and comparing different framings of computational thinking\n\n\nYasmine stressed on the fact that computational thinking is all of these framings, although K-12 computer science instruction need not encompass all these framings - the answers are diverse for different communities and contexts. Here‚Äôs a quote which I really liked from her talk\n\n‚ÄúChildren should learn to program in order to have a deeper sense of the working of their own minds‚Äù\n\n\n\nAlways Provide Context: The Effects of Code Context on Programming Error Message Enhancement\nIn the session after the morning break, Eddie presented his paper which looked at how large language models like GPT-4 can be help in enhancing programming error messages (PEMs). He looked at four different variants of enhancing PEMs - (1) the standard javac compiler messages (2) Decaf, which is an IDE that does some enhancement on error messages, (3) javac error messages given to GPT-4 and (4) javac error messages along with code context given to GPT-4. As expected, when GPT-4 was provided the error message along with the code context, it provided the correct explanation of the errors, and also provided specific fixes for erroneous programs. Does this mean that GPT-4 is the silver bullet for PEM enhancement? Not quite, as there are issues such as instances of providing confidently wrong answers, as well as accessibility. More details in the paper.\n\n\nProgrammers‚Äô Views on IDE Compilation Mechanisms\nBlueJ is a popular IDE for learning programming. Brett Becker and his co-authors looked at how variations in compilation, error indication, and error message presentation between different versions (BlueJ 3 and 4) were perceived by programmers. For example, in BlueJ 3, one has to click to compile, whereas BlueJ 4 has auto compilation features. Although there weren‚Äôt much differences at a broad level, the paper does offer certain nuances in difference between the versions, which will likely be of interest to programming IDE designers. More details in the paper.\n\n\nWorking Group Presentation - Teaching Students To Use Programming Error Messages\nA working group is a group of around 10 members who work extensively on a particular topic for 2-3 months leading to the conference. Two days prior to the main conference, working groups meet in person, and continue working on their topic. During the conference, the group presents the status of their work and the plan ahead.\nI attended the presentation of the working group - ‚ÄúTeaching Students To Use Programming Error Messages‚Äù. Dennis Bouvier and his group looked at student experiences of understanding and dealing with programming error messages (PEMs). Students‚Äô usual reactions to error messages are panic, or to look at a particular line number. More than 50% do not even understand the error message. Students were also asked about where they most likely seek help from. Some of them responded that they use textbooks (which is really a bad resource for such things; error messages are almost never mentioned, and even if they are, it is quite generic). Hence, the aim of the working group is to provide resources which can better prepare novice programmers to read and understand error messages. They aim to do this through creating lessons on reading and using PEMs, and developing guidelines for teaching PEM usage.\n\n\nPanel - Best Practices for Developing Computational Thinking\nI really enjoyed this panel moderated by Dan Garcia. The panel members were Sonia Garcha, Madhavan Mukund, and Vipul Shah, all of them who have done significant work to promote computational thinking in schools and universities in India.\n\n\n\nVipul Shah providing a broad description of the Indian School System\n\n\nHere are some notable quotes and ideas from the panel -\n\nWhat is the use of introducing new subjects (like Artificial Intelligence) in school (NEP 2020), when you miss teaching computational thinking concepts?\n\nüí°What are effective ways in which CT and AI can be blended together in the school curriculum such that both are given appropriate emphasis?\n\nHow can you change mindsets of teachers - use an unplugged approach, and don‚Äôt use technical terms initially.\n\n\nWe received complaints from teachers (when we used unplugged activities) - why are we not going to labs? (isn‚Äôt CS = programming?)\n\n\nTribal students use art to express their thoughts.\n\nüí°How can we use art in resource constrained communities to teach computational thinking?\n\nHow can you teach computational thinking before teaching a programming language? Use datasets from everyday life (Example). (Prof.¬†Madhavan and Prof.¬†G Venkatesh use this approach to teach the Computational Thinking course as part of the IITM BS degree programme )\n\n\n\nPoster Presentation - Making CS Education Relevant to the 21st Century\nAt CompEd, I presented a poster which describes joint work with my colleague at FLAME University, Dr.¬†Balaji Kalluri. Balaji and I taught 2 sections of an introductory programming course last year. Many of the students who took this course were not planning to take computing as their major. Hence, we wanted to introduce computing in a way that was relevant and meaningful to them. We came up with a 6T model which blends six critical types of thinking (logical thinking, systems thinking, sustainable thinking, strategic thinking, creative thinking and responsible thinking) into the design of the course. In the course, in addition to lectures and tutorials, learners were exposed to various activities like micro-lectures and creative projects. The six types of critical thinking were blended into these activities. One section was taught using the traditional way, while the other section was taught using the 6T model. We were interested in finding differences in programming performance between the two sections. Our findings did not reveal significant differences in learning, although we reckon that we might find differences in other measures like satisfaction, engagement. The poster can be found here\n\n\n\nOur poster on blending critical thinking into an introductory programming course\n\n\n\n\nEvaluating the Quality of LLM-Generated Explanations for Logical Errors in CS1 Student Programs\nRishabh presented our paper which was a follow up of our ITiCSE paper, where we looked at how well LLMs like GPT3 are able to generate explanations for erroneous student code. We found that some explanations were incomplete and incorrect, and hence could not be directly given to students. In this paper, we wanted to understand TA perceptions of LLM feedback, and do a detailed analysis of LLM feedback for student programs. We asked student TAs to provide feedback to student programs, and rank their peers‚Äô feedback along with the feedback generated by an LLM (TAs were unaware which explanations were LLM-generated). We found that TAs ranked the LLM-generated feedback either as the first or second for most problems. A manual analysis of LLM-generated feedback led to similar conclusions as our ITiCSE paper - the LLM was able to identify at least one logical error in most cases (93%), but we also found at least one incorrect statement in 50% of the cases. More details in the paper.\nüí°Can TAs or instructors take assistance from LLMs to provide feedback for student programs? What are effective strategies to do this?\n\n\nBug-eecha 2.0: An Educational Game for CS1 Students and Instructors\nBug-eecha aims to impart two key skills to students - problem comprehension, and designing valid and through test cases. In the game, for a particular question, a buggy implementation is provided to students. Students have to specify test cases to eliminate buggy implementations. In the second version, the authors improved the interface and also included an initial set of 22 problems and an interface for instructors to create additional problems. More details in the paper. You can try Bug-eecha here\n\n\nA Bug‚Äôs New Life: Creating Refute Questions from Filtered CS1 Student Code Snapshots\nRefute questions are questions which offer an alternative to Explain in Plain English (EiPE) questions. EiPE questions provide a code snippet and asks students to explain the purpose of the code. One drawback of EiPE questions is that students who are not proficient in English might not be able express the goal of the code succintly, even though they know what it does. Instead of asking students to write down what the code does, Refute questions provide a set of options, one of which provides the correct purpose. For each incorrect option, students are required to provide an input and corresponding output and show how it differs from the output of the correct option.\nAnother variant of Refute questions is providing the purpose of the code, and a partly correct solution (which passes some/many test cases, but not all). Students have to provide test cases as evidence to show how the code fails to achieve the intended purpose. The key challenge for instructors is creating these partly correct solutions. In this paper, Nimisha and her co-authors have tried to automate this process of creating refute questions by using snapshots of student solutions from previous offerings of a programming course. The key thing to keep in mind is that the incorrect code should be a plausible solution for the task. They used several strategies to identify incorrect code - (1) code which fails atmost k test cases, (2) latest incorrect submissions, and (3) incorrect solutions which differ from the correct solution by atmost ‚Äòk‚Äô lines. They then asked instructors and TAs to evaluate the effectiveness of the incorrect code in terms of (1) its plausibility as a solution for the task and (2) the whether the complexity of finding a counter-example is acceptable. More details in the paper\n\n\nKeynote - Computational Thinking in Primary Schooling: Thinking Beyond Computer Science\nDr.¬†Aman Yadav from Michigan State University gave an excellent keynote on his work with primary school teachers in the US. Here are some interesting quotes and ideas from the talk.\n\n‚ÄúCT is about thinking and sometimes about computing‚Äù\n\n\nElementary teachers are afraid of using technology. How can we overcome this fear? Start from unplugged activities - e.g.¬†building spaggheti towers\n\n\nUse vocabulary of CT in the classroom. For example, a 3rd grade activity on building paper aeroplanes can be used to introduce debugging\n\n\nCT can be integrated into various subjects like Social Studies and the Arts - http://projects.ctintegration.org/\n\nüí°Many of us discussed how these integrations can be easily translated into the Indian context. Can we do similar CT integrations in NCERT textbooks?\n\n\nDefining Disability Inclusive Education\nRakesh Paladugula, gave an amazing keynote on ‚ÄúDefining Disability Inclusive Education‚Äù. Rakesh works with Adobe as a Sr Product Manager in Accessibility. Around 16% of the world population has some disability. Throughout the talk, Rakesh gave examples of how people with disabilities find it difficult to do even simple tasks inspite of the availability of accessible software.\n\nIt is not only important to make software technology accessible, the content should be accessible as well. For example, a learning management system may have accessibility features, but if the content contains snapshots or images of textbook pages, the screen reader cannot read it.\nWhen we write documents, we may use different font sizes for different levels of headings, and not necessary the appropriate heading levels. The issue with this is that screen readers cannot differentiate between different font sizes, making it difficult for people who use them to make sense of different headings.\nTools like Be My Eyes use AI to increase accessibility by automatically generating alternative text for images.\nKey takeaway: It is important to integrate accessibility into all activities.\n\nI and others got a chance to talk to Rakesh during dinner the day before his keynote. We had a great discussion on accessibility work in the tech industry, and the lack of accessibility topics in the Indian CS curriculum. Swaroop Joshi and his students from BITS Pilani, Goa are doing great work in addressing the lack of accessibility in the Indian curriculum. We definitely need more people to work in this imporant area and address problems specific to the Indian context.\n\n\nCOMPUTE Workshop - Getting Started with Computing Education Research\nLakshmi, Deepti and I conducted a workshop primarily for CS faculty on how one should get started with doing research in Computing Education. One way this workshop differed from the usual workshop format was that we conducted 6 online sessions between September to December, prior to the conference. These sessions familiarized participants on what computing education research is, how to come up with research ideas, and how to design research studies. Participants who actively participated in the online sessions had the opportunity to present their ideas as a poster in COMPUTE. Many joined in for the online sessions, and we had 3 participants (Shabana K M, Parthasarathy P D, and Madhavi Amondkar) who presented their ideas in COMPUTE. Although we were a bit apprehensive at the start on how the sessions will pan out, we were happy with the participation, and we hope that the workshop will serve as an impetus for faculty to start working on their research ideas in computing education.\n\n\n\nDeepti introducing Research Designs in our workshop\n\n\n\n\nBuilding Community\nThe computing education research community in India is growing steadily. It is heartening to see people working on important and relevant problems in the Indian context. CompEd and COMPUTE were also a great way to reconnect with people, especially from my alma mater, EdTech IIT Bombay. There were 13 attendees (Profs, PhD students, MTech students, and alumni), and it was encouraging to see them carry the CSEd thread of our department forward. I look forward to see what new and interesting research ideas COMPUTE 2024 has in store!\n\n\n\nAn EdTech IIT Bombay mini-reunion at CompEd"

    "text": "Paulo Blikstein - Transforming Maker Education into a Platform for Cultural Enrichment and Social Imagination\n\nThere is no ‚Äúfinal formula‚Äù for education. There is always a perenial battle of design and re-design. Education is incremental.\n\n\nWe need to transition from the ‚Äúinformation transmission‚Äù model to the ‚Äúenriching reinterpretation and reconstruction‚Äù model.\n\n\nIt is very difficult to remove spaces\n\nPaulo was refering to the advantage of creating designated ‚Äúspaces‚Äù (e.g.¬†a makerspace room) in a school. Even though curricula, activities and teachers change, a space once allocated remains for a long time.\n\nMost educational interventions do not get implemented because teachers are afraid.\n\n\nIdea: Introduce a new kind of teacher - ‚Äúa pedagogical redesign teacher‚Äù to partner with teachers to integrated making into the curriculum\n\nThe ‚Äúfear of failure‚Äù is a valid concern that teachers have in introducing a new activity in their classroom. The ‚Äúpedagogical redesign teacher‚Äù partners with curriculum teachers to redesign activities, and hence can alleviate curriculum teachers‚Äô concerns of failing.\n\n\n\nClay making in Brazil involves a lot of rituals and social rules, and non-human entities such as the ‚ÄúMother of Clay‚Äù\n\n\n\nDocumenting how people makes things in their own context brings out the cultural richness involved in making things. There are non-traditional practices that can inform learning of making in classrooms.\n\n(Paulo was talking about this in Brazilian contexts;seems to be possible in India, which has a rich diversity in terms of making).\n\n\n\nThe plant burns at the same temperature as the baking of the cookies in this oven. Hence, the plant acts as a thermometer. These communities have a lot of scientific knowledge embeded in their making practices.\n\n\n\nMaking can be done for survival and creativity, but also for ‚Äúsprituality‚Äù, ‚Äúaesthetic enjoyment‚Äù, ‚Äúidentity affirmation‚Äù, ‚Äúpolitical organization‚Äù, and ‚Äúcultural transmission‚Äù\n\nHow can we re-imagine making for these purposes?\nThe entire keynote video can be found here."

The panelists were:\n\nNirmal Patel - CEO of Smart Paper and Chief Data Scientist at Playpower Labs\nMandar Kulkarni - Co Founder of Gatuvit and The Labs\nRitesh Agarwal - VP at Educational Initiatives\nVeenita Shah - Head Research & Strategy at Tata ClassEdge\n\nHere are some salient quotes from the panel presentations and discussions.\n\nWe don‚Äôt need more solutions; we need solutions used in the right way\n\n\nHow do you make EdTech that works rather than technology that shines?\n\n\nEffective implementation (of EdTech interventions on the ground) cannot be envisioned without effective training\n\n\nEdTech in India places a lot of emphasis on data collection and assessments, but not much focus on contextualisation and teacher training.\n\n\nContext is important, especially in India. Context involves not only contextualising content (e.g.¬†pizza vs.¬†roti vs.¬†dosa), but also delivery (how to deliver solutions to urban vs rural populations)\n\n\nEdTech solutions should cater to 4 types of teachers - those with (1) high motivation and high competence, (2) high motivation but low competence, (3) low motivation but high competence and (4) low motivation and low competence\n\nI came back from the conference with a renewed hope that EdTech in India is moving in the right direction - it‚Äôs not just about profits and providing solutions to the masses, but in understanding the complexities and nuances that are needed in providing an enriching learning experience to the next generation of learners in India. These are exciting times for EdTech in India, and I‚Äôm glad that I am getting to experience this first-hand and contribute in small ways towards this grand vision of improving Indian education. Can‚Äôt wait to see what T4E 2024 has in store!"
